Git: A Developer's Friend

In folders deep where code files dwell,
Git tracks each change and stores them well.
With commits made and branches new,
Version control will see you through.

From staging ground to repository,
Each snapshot tells your coding story.
Push and pull with confidence bright,
Git keeps your projects organized right.

When teams collaborate on projects grand,
Git merges changes with steady hand.
Through pull requests and careful review,
Software grows with me and you.
